# END TO END MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT
  
  ## Introduction About the Data :
  The goal of this project is to give people an estimate of how much they need based on
  their individual health situation. After that, customers can work with any health 
  insurance carrier and its plans and perks while keeping the projected cost from our 
  study in mind. This can assist a person in concentrating on the health side of an   
  insurance policy rather han the ineffective part.

## Context
The insurance.csv dataset contains 1338 observations (rows) and 7 features (columns). The dataset contains 4 numerical features (age, bmi, children and expenses) and 3 nominal features (sex, smoker and region) that were converted into factors with numerical value designated for each level.

## Acknowledgements
Insurance.csv file is obtained from the Machine Learning course website (Spring 2017) from Professor Eric Suess at http://www.sci.csueastbay.edu/~esuess/stat6620/#week-6.

## Inspiration
The purposes of this exercise to look into different features to observe their relationship, and plot a multiple linear regression based on several features of individual such as age, physical/family condition and location against their existing medical expense to be used for predicting future medical expenses of individuals that help medical insurance to make decision on charging the premium.
