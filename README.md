# END TO END MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT

I am excited to present my Student Performance Prediction project, which leverages machine learning to analyze and predict student test scores based on various factors such as gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation. By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and applying multiple regression algorithms including Linear Regression, CatBoost, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and SVM, this project uncovers key insights into what affects student performance. Furthermore, I containerized the application using Docker and deployed it with an AWS CI/CD pipeline, ensuring seamless and efficient updates. This project not only provides valuable insights for educators but also showcases the power of machine learning in enhancing educational outcomes.


## Situation

Understanding the factors affecting student performance is crucial for educators to provide better support and improve educational outcomes. I developed a machine learning project to analyze how variables such as gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation impact student test scores.

## Task

My task was to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), apply various regression algorithms to predict student performance, and deploy the project using Docker for containerization and an AWS CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.

## Action

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collected student performance data and cleaned it by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to understand data distribution, relationships, and key insights.
Model Training and Evaluation: Applied multiple regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, CatBoost, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and SVM. Evaluated models using metrics like R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Containerization: Used Docker to containerize the application, ensuring consistency across different environments.
Deployment: Set up a CI/CD pipeline on AWS for automated deployment, ensuring efficient and reliable updates to the application.

## Result

The project successfully predicted student test scores with high accuracy, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing performance. The best-performing model achieved an R-squared value of 0.85, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual scores. The deployment process was streamlined with Docker and AWS CI/CD, ensuring the application was consistently and reliably updated. This project demonstrated the potential of machine learning to enhance educational strategies and support data-driven decision-making in education.
